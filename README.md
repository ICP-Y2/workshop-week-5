### Simulate SMART Sensor and Actuator

#### 1.	Why is Servo Motor a Smart Actuator?
> NOTE: MENTION THE REASON ONLY
```

```

#### 2.	Research how to use servo motor with Arduino, libraries and sample code.
> HINT: CIRCUIT CONNECTION, PROGRAM SETUP,
```

```

#### 3.	Following the tutorial, add servo motor to the circuit and demonstrate following conditions:
`	Suppose the servo is controlling the flap of air vent. Design an embedded system that sets the flap angle according to the temperature read by TMP36.`
1.	Flap angle 0 degree for temperature < 20 ℃
2.	Flap angle 90 degree for temperature > 20 ℃ and < 40 ℃
3.	Flap angle 180 degree for temperature > 40 ℃
